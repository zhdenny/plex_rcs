# config.yml - for plex rclone cache scaner (plex_rcs)
#
# Options are pretty straight forward. This program
# MUST run on the same host as your Plex server and yhour
# Plex server MUST run in a docker container.
#
# host: this is the hostname or IP of your plex server
#       (should not change from localhost)
# port: port that your plex server runs on (default 32400)
# token: Your Plex-X-Token master token
# backend: cache backend (either cache or vfs)
# docker: true/false whether Plex runs in a docker container
# container: Name of your plex container (default: plex)
# media_root: this is the root folder that contains your media
#
# More on media_root:
#
# When rclone detects a new file, it will show up in the log as the sub-folder
# of the rclone cache remote. Example would be "tvshows/Grimm/Season 1/". This
# setting maps that to where the script can find that folder in your docker container or
# on your system (if not using docker)
# example: "/media/tvshows/Grimm/Season 1/". You may need to play around with this.
